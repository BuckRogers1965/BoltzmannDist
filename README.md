Scale Invariance and Efficient Computation in Boltzmann Distributions: A Novel Approach
 Author: James M. Rogers, SE Ohio, 30 Sep 2024, 0942

1. Introduction
This report summarizes a novel computational approach for handling Boltzmann distributions, leveraging their scale-invariant properties. The method, developed through our discussion, offers significant computational efficiency and draws interesting parallels with concepts in quantum computing, while maintaining classical determinism.

2. Key Concepts
2.1 Scale Invariance
Scale invariance is the fundamental property that enables this computational method. For the Boltzmann distribution, this means that the shape of the distribution remains consistent across different temperatures, with only the scale changing.

2.2 Representative Point
The method uses a single point (e.g., the 50% point at 5000K) to represent the entire family of Boltzmann distributions across all temperatures. This point encapsulates the essential characteristics of the distribution.

2.3 Scaling Factors
Various properties of the distribution at any temperature can be derived by applying specific scaling factors to the representative point. These include:

Point energy
Peak energy
Area under the curve
Peak frequency
2.4 O(1) Complexity
All calculations using this method have constant time complexity, O(1), regardless of the temperature or the property being calculated.

2.5 Composability of Scaling Factors
A notable aspect of the waveform collapse technique is the composability of its scaling factors. By combining different scaling factors, we can derive additional properties of the Boltzmann distribution and explore more complex relationships within the data. This composability is a key factor in the flexibility and power of the method, allowing researchers to build upon a set of basic scaling factors to investigate a wide range of phenomena.

For example, the peak energy is calculated in the basic implementation below and then scaled to the specific temperature we are examining.  With O(1) efficiency at full precision.  

This composability suggests that the waveform collapse technique could be extended to explore increasingly complex properties of the Boltzmann distribution and other scale-invariant systems. As we continue to investigate the potential applications of this method, the ability to combine and build upon these scaling factors will be crucial for unlocking new insights and innovations in computational physics and beyond.

3. Implementation
A basic implementation of this method can be structured as follows:

python
import numpy as np

from scipy import constants



class BoltzmannDistribution:

    def __init__(self):

        self.representative_point = 4.7849648084645400e-20  # 50% point at 5000K

        self.reference_temperature = 5000

        

    def scale_to_temperature(self, T):

        return T / self.reference_temperature

    

    def point_energy(self, T):

        return self.representative_point * self.scale_to_temperature(T)





    def peak_energy(self, T):

        return self.point_energy(T) / 0.2457097414250071665

    

    def area_under_curve(self, T):

        return self.point_energy(T) * T * 10e-22/50.20444590190353665093425661

    

    def peak_frequency(self, T):

        return self.point_energy(T) * 10e32 / .1627836661598892



def planck_peak_frequency(T):

    """Calculate peak frequency using Wien's displacement law"""

    return 2.821439 * constants.k * T / constants.h



def print_results(temperatures):

    bd = BoltzmannDistribution()

    

    print("Temperature (K) | Point Energy   | Peak Energy    | Area Under Curve | New Peak Hz    | Planck's Law   | Ratio %")

    print("-" * 118)

    

    for T in temperatures:

        point_energy = bd.point_energy(T)

        peak_energy = bd.peak_energy(T)

        area = bd.area_under_curve(T)

        new_peak_hz = bd.peak_frequency(T)

        planck_peak = planck_peak_frequency(T)

        ratio = new_peak_hz / planck_peak*100

        

        print(f"{T:14d} | {point_energy:.6e} | {peak_energy:.6e} | {area:.6e} | {new_peak_hz:.6e} | {planck_peak:.6e} | {ratio:.14f}")



# Define temperatures

temperatures = [4, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000, 10000, 15000, 20000]
